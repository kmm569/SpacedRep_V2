				<h2>What is "Spaced Repetition"?</h2>
				<p class="content-desc">
					Spaced repetition is a powerful technique that will help you memorize
					information in much less time than it would take otherwise. The idea
					of spaced repetition is to space out your repetitions – or review
					sessions – so that you are not trying to cram all the knowledge into
					your brain at once.<sup

				</p>
				<p>
					The distribution of study days will always look something like this:
				</p>
				<p>|-s---s------s--------s----------------s---Test|</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content-sub">
				<h2>What are some benefits?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Continually re-exposes you to information</li>
					<li>Helps strengthen your memory</li>
					<li>Trains recall over recognition</li>
					<li>
						Spend more time actively studying rather than passively taking in
						information
					</li>
				</ul>

					<div id="spaced-math">
						<p>
							Below is the raw Javascript line that calculates how much time
							should go between each day:
						</p>
						<p><code>const mult = [2.175, 2, 1.825, 1.625, 1.45]</code></p>
						<p>
							<code
								>Math.floor( Math.pow( mult[topicDifficulty[i].value - 1], p
								))</code
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							While this looks confusing, it can be broken down into an easier
							to understand math equation. Assume first level of difficulty (1),
							as well as calculating the first day you should study (p=1).
						</p>
						<p>\(Floor( 2.175^1 )\)</p>
						<p>
							This equation is telling us that if the topic is easy, we should
							start studying about 2 days after the first day we learn the
							topic.
						</p>
						<p>
							Keep in mind that the harder a topic is, the sooner you will begin
							to review the topic. These values are shown above in the
							<code>const mult</code>, and are as follows: 2.175, 2, 1.825,
							1.625, and 1.45.
						</p>
						<p>
							When first starting to study, these values won't change too much;
							you will begin to review 1-2 days after you learn the topic.
							However, once you get closer to the test date, these days will
							become farther and farther apart.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below is an example demonstrating the difference in days between
							the fifth study session when calculating an easy topic versus a
							super hard topic:
						</p>
						<p>Easy Topic: \(Floor( 2.175^5 ) = 48\) Days from start date</p>
						<p>Hard Topic: \(Floor( 1.45^5 ) = 6\) Days from start date</p>
						<p>
							Keep in mind that with both of these equations, you are only
							studying 5 times, the only difference being the amount of time
							between each study session.

				<h2>How do I use this tool?</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the Topic Scheduler page</li>
					<li>Enter your test date at the top</li>
					<li>
						If you would like to use the same year for everything (so that you
						don&#39;t need to type it in repeatedly), check the box.
					</li>
					<li>Enter the number of topics you need to study.</li>
					<li>
						Enter a name for each topic. If you leave the names blank, a number
						will be assigned.
					</li>
					<li>
						Enter the dates that you would like to start studying each topic.
						This could be the day you learn the material, or just the day you
						plan on starting.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, rate the difficulty of the topic. The harder a topic is,
						the more often it should be studied.
					</li>
					<li>Hit calculate!</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					From here, a list of study dates will come up, along with a calendar
					to help visualize the study plan. If there is a superscript on a date
					(and it's highlighted), you can hover over it to see a list of the
					study topics for that day. The number represents the number of topics
					to study on that day.<br />At the bottom of the page, you can also
					export these dates to your calendar, or start the process over.
